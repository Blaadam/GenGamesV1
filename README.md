# GenGamesV1

GenGamesV1 was a teacher-guided development of a WPF Application where we would learn how to make a Desktop Application following the MVVM methodology. In this development, I differed from the other students in my course by making a system that makes page creation simple and intuitive, rather than having to independently change the visibility status of each page.

The application utilised [MaterialDesignInXaml@4.9.0](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit/releases/tag/v4.9.0) - this allowed the application to use professional icons and components based on the Google Design Langage, Material Design.
